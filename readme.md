🍽️ Food Ordering ChatBot

This is a simple and interactive **Food Ordering ChatBot** built as a fun project to simulate how users can order food through a chat interface.
The bot helps users browse the menu, add items to the cart, check their order, and finally place it — all through a natural chat flow.

I built this to practice chatbot logic, UI handling, and basic flow management inside an Android app.
